# PGA Golfer Statistical Analysis

This project analyzes PGA golfer statistics over multiple seasons, utilizing Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Overview

The analysis focuses on identifying key metrics affecting a golfer's success, including Greens in Regulation (GIR), Driving Distance (DDIS), Driving Accuracy (DACC), and Putts per Hole (PUTTS). Statistical methods such as ANOVA are employed to draw insights from the data.

## Project Structure

- `code/`: Contains Python scripts for data analysis.
- `data/`: Holds the dataset used in the analysis.
- `report/`: Detailed report containing analysis findings and conclusions.

## Key Sections

1. **ANOVA Analysis: Identifying Strongest Correlation**
   - Utilized ANOVA, F-statistic, and p-values to conclude that GIR has the strongest correlation to making cuts.

2. **Comparative Analysis: Scottie Scheffler vs. Nate Lashley**
   - Conducted a detailed comparison between Scottie Scheffler (1st rank) and Nate Lashley (100th rank) in the 2022-2023 season.

3. **Scottie Scheffler's Metrics Over Three Seasons**
   - Explored the progression and regression of key metrics in Scottie Scheffler's performance across the 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 seasons.
